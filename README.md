### **About Siren**
Siren, Kraken RoboTradeAssistant, a right hand tool for a new Kraken user to navigate the basics of the platform such as buying, selling, staking and fetching current market prices through a simple, user-friendly interactive chat. Siren is unlike other “chatbots”, she is a Robo-Trade-Assistant, a sophisticated bot, who is able to execute trades, fetch market prices and stake coins all through an engaging, personal interaction. Once the user has passed the Kraken authentication and validation process, a (new user needing assistance) signal dispatches Siren. The chat icon pops up and Siren waits for the user to verbally state or type in a key word or phrase, triggering the interaction leading to the execution of the user's request.  

The details and functionality of Siren and her workflow are as follows: We created Siren combining AWS Lex and AWS Lambda function. AWS Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. AWS Lex allows you, as a developer, to build bots to increase contact center productivity, automate tasks, and drive operational efficiencies across the enterprise. The key benefits to AWS Lex are simplicity and democratized deep learning technologies. Amazon Lex allows you to create your own basic chatbot in minutes.
